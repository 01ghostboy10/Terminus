[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] Hi, m6kj1rp 
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] how did you get my contact??
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] I'm assuming Palu didn't tell you–
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] I asked her for your contact, mostly because I was just curious…
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] About what??
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] She told me you got into the Archivist server, finally.
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] What do you think of it?
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] what do you mean? It's okay, I guess
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] Slightly underwhelming lol but nothing too weird
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] Why?
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] No reason, just curious?
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] was that a question?
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] When you were online yesterday, did you see a user with an alphanumeric username? Like mine?
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] uhhh no
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] Wait actually,
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] I think so, their user started with K
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] I see, thanks
[color=#3588fc]m6kj1rp:[/color] I need to go now, bye.
[color=#9ba87e]you:[/color] okay? bye
