This is a Godot project made for the Midnight hackathon by Hackclub!

The game is meant to simulate an OS, in the form of a mystery-horror story that unfolds as the player discovers more of the system.
Features include a Terminal, Notes and Messages app that include the clues the you need to progress through the storyline!
There's also another app that I won't spoil much about, but includes most of the input of the plot :)
(_The last app is in development, so some functionality may not be available with the current version._)

My hope is to have all the mechanics fully finished during future development as well as perhaps some easter eggs to add some spice to the game.
